== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to code themes or plugins? =

Absolutely not. It's really plug'n play

= Does it block cookies before they’re explicitly accepted by user? =

Sure, you can choose opt-in or opt-out mode to let it work as you wish.

= Does it use jQuery? =

No, you can be safe from plugins conflict. It's been developed using Cookies Enabler Js Library developed by Nicholas Ruggeri:  https://github.com/nicholasruggeri/cookies-enabler

= What about other cookies not supported natively? =

You can enable **Custom JS & Iframe url** to add any javascript/iframe you need to manage and block.
